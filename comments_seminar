too specialised
Don't use GLW, ADS, BPGGSZ
big picture at the start, with which measurements
x cabbibo -> cabibbo
need more explaining, too much flavour physics
more conclusion and general interest for people outside of lhcb
x slide 12: mention that this is before b factories
x slide 16: stress that we want to overconstrain the UT
slide 16: why is it a challenge even though it's a tree level, and why is lhcb doing so well on this
mention that 4 degrees is the target for run 2
use more colours
spend more time explaining how charm factories can measure strong phases
explain why the strong phase of Dpi0 and Dgamma is opposite
slide 58: cite paper by Bondar
Slide 2: need an overview slide with where we are as a collaboration before this slide, make it clear it's run 1 and 2
x slide 6: discuss sakhrarov condidations are how it connects antimatter asymmetry to CPV
x slide 8: rephrase because we already know SM can't explain the asymmetry
x slide 8: it's also important to understand the interactions between quarks and if the CKM matrix is unitary? Need a deeper understanding! Need to understand where to look for new physics, which may not have the CKM structure
slide 10: leading order CKM matrix to the CPV terms, perhaps mention that before with 2x2 matrix there is no CPV, define lambda, rho, eta
x mention that 2008 nobel prize was for cp violation
x slide 10: "in the SM, with only 3 generations, V must be unitary"
slide 10: mention that since it adds to zero it is a triangle, mention that there are 6 triangle but only this one has large angles, and also mention the alternative defintions
x between slide 12 and 13, add something about the other measurements of the UT (in particular sin(2beta) and the mixing measurements of B0/Bs)
mention how beta is measured very well, and why alpha is difficult to measure at LHCb
x slide 12: no CPV meausurements in this plot from B factories!
x slide 12: Add the whole evolution of the UT from ckmfitter, or just 2012 (pre lhcb)
x slide 16: mention that we don't expect new physics at tree level, but we expect new particles in loops
x slide 16: mention that theory uncertiantnies are small because we measure delta_B and r_B directly
x slide 16: mention that this plot is old!
x slide 17: explain where the uncertainties come from at loop level
x slide 17: "global fit assuming unitary"
x slide 16: mention that we are only focusing on the direct gamma measurement, but there is also another measurement here
x slide 16: replace result with the LHCb combination, or just remove slide completely! Loop level plot is the "SM prediction"
x slide 17: Don't expect new physics at tree level
x slide 20: run 1 and 2 lhcb detector
x slide 22: how does the VELO and RICH improve the mass plots
slide 22: mention the trigger and how it's improved
x slide 23: identity particles from b and d decays
x slide 25: "superposition when D and Dbar decay to the same final state"
x slide 25: colour and CKM suppression
x slide 25: split slide into two, much slower explanation with clear definitions of rB and deltaB
slide 25: Why is gamma hard: B->DK is suppressed, and interference is small
x slide 26: "severla methods are used to measure gamma precisely
x slide 26: Put GLW in brackets with reference
x slide 32: self-conjugate multi-body
slide 30: put values of rB and rD on the diagram
slide 30: mention that it's the interference of DCS and CF
x slide 28: large B+ and B-, and use a line to show the asymmetry
slide 27: mention that we cannot get a unique value of gamma
slide 31: slide with contours of gamma from Donal's paper
slide 30: discuss rD and deltaD and where we take them from
slide 31: spend more time explaining what partially reconstructed is and point out with lines and box, and why Dstar has opposite asymmetry
slide 31: mention that i will talk about the part reco later
slide 31: mention the low BF of DCS Kpi and why the B factories could not see this
slide 31: discuss features of the low mass background, low mid ID, low combinatorial
x slide 28: show how large the mid ID from Dpi would be without PID
slide 28: simplified legend or arrows to point out what the different things are
slide 28: show the Dpi plots first and talk through the detector features
slide 33: what is phi?
slide 33: what is dalitz plot?
slide 33: Discuss how many degrees of freedom an N body decay has
slide 36: explain the features of the dalitz plot (Kstar resonance and KS)
slide 36: explain more clearly what a dalitz plot is (resonances and structures)
slide 37: how are bins defined and how are the ci/si measured
slide 37: why do they need to be measured at CLEO and BESIII?
slide 37: it's because the uncertainty can't be evaluated with the model
slide 37: add a slide about model dependent vs independent, and make it explicit that LHCb uses model independnet inputs only
slide 37: stress that gamma has zero theory uncertainty so we should not introduce one with the model
slide 37: make it clear that the measurement doesn't depend on detection and production asymmetries, and that the systematics are small!
slide 38: remove the mention of charm
slide 39: update plot and just mention that there's another "lobe", or show both
slide 41: Remove accronyms and typo "unique"
slide 46: "not covered today" -> "coming soon"
slide 48: need to highlight the value on the plot
slide 48: this is better than the target for run 2
slide 48: mention the legacy measurements from babar and belle
Remove slide 49 and mention all mention of charm
DON'T MENTION CHARM!
slide 48: copy the table from the CONF note with all the different B modes, and that most of it is there but I will report on the new results
slide 47: highlight the small tension and say it's statistical
slide 48: "combination of gamma" -> "combination of measurmeents"
slide 48: mention in small writing that we benefit from BESIII and charm mixing inputs
slide 47: give a quick tease about a new B0 measurement that resolves the tension

slide 55: remove comment about Bs
slide 55: expand on "CP obsrevables" (red line), spend more time explaining this
slide 55: move this slide after slide 56
slide 56: value of gamma is lower so is expected to bring the discrepancy down
slide 56: "compatible with expectation that it should be 3 times larger"
slide 58: explain sign swap
slide 58: change pi to 180 degrees
slide 58: bring back ADS plot
slide 58: mention this has been measured in Donal's analysis
slide 58: mention in detector bit about the calorimeter
slide 60: opposite asymmetries doesn't give any information, don't mention this
slide 61: show Donal's of Dst contours and anticipate the combination of the two which will provide very strong constraints for gamma
slide 65: my explanation was the same as for KSpipi, play down the 5D phase space and focus on how we use the amplitud emodel to define the binning scheme
slide 67: mention Q value
slide 69: "inputs from charm threshold"
slide 70: symmetric rB uncertainties
slide 70: comment on the 3 sigma tension, but explain the model dependence

slide 72: current average doesn't include the new results yet
slide 73: remind what the current combination of gamma is, and what new results are coming in (new slide)
slide 74: forgot to add "on gamma"
slide 74: mention that with software trigger the efficienices are much higher
slide 72: point 2 B0 will really improve the precision and hopefully become competitive with B+
slide 74: add the same ckmfitter plots again and show how we can reach loop level precision and match the indirect precision
slide 74: indirect preicsion comes from lattice QCD so it will also improve!
